<p> Have you ever wondered how people get their own websites? Have you ever wanted your own personalized site?
Well if you do I can show you how to start off today. What you need to begin is a domain name. Think of your 
domain name as your address on the internet. Next you need a place for your files to be stored which is called 
web hosting. Web hosting is like purchasing land to build your home on in real world terms. After you have web hosting you can 
begin to build your website or 'home' online. Most people don't have web design skills these days so you can either hire
someone to build a site for you or install a cms (content management system) such as wordpress which is used 
by many top companies today.
